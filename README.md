# ANNz+
ANNz+ is an upgraded version of artificial neural networks photometric redshift estimation, referred to as ANNz by [Collister & Lahav (2004)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/383254), allowing it to remain viable and competitive within the photo-z community today. It builds upon the capabilities of the original algorithm, [ANNz](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucapola/annz.html), offering improved performance and flexibility to use multiple activation functions.
